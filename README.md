# VDP-Various_Desmos_Projects-
A collection of projects I've worked on using the Desmos graphing calculator, pushing its capabilities to the limit.

The Desmos calculator, while a useful tool, isn't exactly designed for coding. However, with a bit of creativity and persistence, you can get it to do some pretty impressive things.

[Clock](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/z4svs6yqgs):
  A simple program that displays a clock. Unfortunately, due to Desmos’ isolated environment, it must be manually synced.

[DLMC](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/2sonedz4wf):
  A first attempt at creating a "classic" program, inspired by the Little Man Computer (LMC) model. It leverages Desmos’ calculator features to reduce program size by fusing calculations.

[SPM](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/hmh7cu7sna):
  An experiment in generating more complex visuals, evolving from binary pixel-based models to models with individually selectable colors.

[Chess(2.0-alpha)](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/vsnimfhcto):
  A small chess program testing the user interface capabilities of Desmos.

[SMBD(2.0-alpha)](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/hej87hgrxr):
  A recreation of the original super mario bros, with dynamic level data.
